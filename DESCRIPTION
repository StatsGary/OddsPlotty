Description: Uses the outputs of a logistic regression model, from caret <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=caret>, to build an odds plot.
    This allows for the rapid visualisation of odds plot ratios and works best with the outputs of CARET's GLM model class, by returning the final trained model.
